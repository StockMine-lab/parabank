# parabank# ParaBank Test Automation Ecosystem (Playwright + TypeScript)

A production-grade, highly scalable end-to-end testing framework built using modern web architecture and AI-augmented engineering principles.

## 🏗️ Architectural Design
This framework strictly implements an **MVC (Model-View-Controller) Paradigm** to ensure zero-flakiness, maximum execution speed, and long-term maintainability.

*   **Model Layer (Backend/State):** Direct REST API integration for instantaneous data seeding and user state injection, completely bypassing slow UI flows for setup.
*   **View Layer (UI/POM):** Strictly isolated, type-safe Page Object Models (POM) utilizing Playwright's robust locator strategies and dynamic selectors.
*   **Controller Layer (Specs):** Clean, descriptive test files (`*.spec.ts`) mapping business logic and asserting end-to-end user journeys.

## ⚡ Engineering Patterns
*   **Lazy Loading:** Elements are resolved dynamically at the moment of interaction.
*   **AI-First Quality Assurance:** Leveraging context-driven prompting (CO-STAR framework) to map exhaustive edge-case matrices and enforce a true Shift-Left testing methodology.
